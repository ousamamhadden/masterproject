    " #\"I love my WeHo apartment. It's like a private oasis. Full of natural light and all the comfort you can ask for. The pool, a few steps away from the entrance door, is always clean and ready for you to jump in. The best  location for visitors to LA in the heart of West Hollywood. Within walking distance from all the trendy shops, bars, and restaurants and the famous Sunset strip. Parking on the street is readily available either in front of or within a block of my building with your personal parking permit.  You'll sleep in a private very comfortable  twin bed in a room with natural light and hardwood floor. You have plenty of space for your personal belongings.  Access to  a beautiful living room and a 62\"\" TV with  DVD player. You'll have connection to Netflix and high-speed WiFi. There is a full kitchen if you desire is to cook your own meals. Guests will share the full bathrooms equipped with fresh towels and toiletries at all times for your convenience.  The Neighborhood Is super safe and very well kept. There are a lot of great bars and restaurants within walking distance and guests with cars can easily find street parking. Getting Around There is a bus stop less than a block away, but i none This apartment is located in the midst of West Hollywood, close  to Museum row, walking distance to Melrose, the Sunset strip and two Farmers Market/ 5 min drive to the Grove,  to Beverly Hills, 5 min drive to the Hollywood district, 20 min to Venice Beach (depends on traffic), 20 min to Downtown (depends on traffic), 25 min drive to LAX (depends on traffic). You'll find it to be an urban Oasis. 20 minutes to DTLA and Silverlake and to recently remodeled Echo Park. Easy to get around by car to all of Los Angeles. Centrally located. Fantastic restaurants and cafes nearby.  If you have a car, then travel around Los Angeles is easy as the apartment is centrally located and highway access is pretty close.  You'll find it to be a convenient location to visit LA and suburbs. You will be steps away from everything!!! Whether your personality is party - calm - sporty- artsy or coffee -  you won't be disappointed with the area because everything is in front of your nose! :-) The Sunset strip is Like any apartment, hotel, hostel or AirBnB, the common area is shared, so be respectful of  that. Do your own dishes and don't leave your personal stuff lying around.  To protect all parties involved all bookings must be made through the Airbnb site. My guests get one key of the house and one key of their room, so they are free to come and go whenever they want. Access to the house is for paying guests only. You are not permitted to invite people to your room or to the house. Smoking is not permitted inside the house. Please treat the apartment as if it's your home, not a hotel. To make sharing comfortable for everyone, clean up after yourself and don't leave dishes in the sink :-) Please let me know if you break or stain anything, so it can be replaced in time for the following guests. Smoking is permitted around the pool area. Please don't leave cigarette or any kind of garbage around. No dogs or other animals are allowed in the apartment. Feel free to use any of my spices, and anyt Rent a car, take Uber, take the bus on Sunset, or simply walk around the neighborhood. Getting around is easy. There is Laundry in building located next to the apartment. The washer  cost 1.25 and the drying depends on how long you want to dry your clothes. Please have quarters  available. There is no change machine in the laundry room. If you feel like working out at home, there is a stationary bike at your disposal and a couple of small weights. I don't work a traditional 9-5 so some days I am home all morning or afternoon.  Other days I am gone most of the day. I have classes at UCLA a couple of evenings so I don't get home until after 10:00 pm. In the dining area, a huge table is used for eating and as a work desk when needed.  Some days I stay home working or I go work at the beautiful WeHo library down the street. It has a magnificent view of the Pacific Design Center and the Hollywood Hills. You can't do better than this for your personal office. I am a very easy-going but I do have a few  rules to make things easy: This is a non-smoking, non-vaping, non-drug, non-partying, quiet environment.  If you are coming to the city just for partying or late night life, I'm probably not the best choice. For everyone's safety, I ask that you not bring strangers into the property. The toilet can clog, please nothing foreign other than toilet paper down the toilet. Pets are not allowed in this place. I keep the wood floors very clean because I like to walk barefoot in the house.  You will find my home organized and clean. I appreciate you keeping the place in the same state you found it in. There are two different trash cans. One for recycling and one for normal trash. The bins are outside in front of the garage so if the trash is full please don't leave it in the house when you leave. It is 3 steps away :-) Thank you. I am about clean, quiet, happy co-existence, and very accommodating and respectful of your privacy. I hope to share my home\"\n",

      "All are welcome at Fog Haven, a cozy studio apt. in the scenic Outer Richmond area of SF. Fog Haven guests enjoy:  close proximity to Golden Gate Park, Ocean Beach, the Legion of Honor, Land's End, Sutro Heights Park, & local businesses  easy public transit access to the rest of SF  a library of area guidebooks & maps  high-speed wifi  a king-size bed  a full kitchen  free tea & coffee  on-site parking & laundry (extra fee) Book to experience SF like a born-and-bred resident! Fog Haven is a classic San Francisco apartment.  In the 1920s, San Francisco real estate developers set their sights on the largely undeveloped wilderness on the western half of the peninsula, called Outside Lands.  In order to lure home-buyers to these outposts among the sand dunes, these early pioneering houses were built grandly, but the ground floor was left unfinished to reduce costs.  It proved to be ingenious as the 20th century evolved, as most of these unfinished ground floors could subsequently be converted into garage space, and \"in-law\" apartments like Fog Haven. As guests of Fog Haven, you'll get to enjoy the painstakingly-restored architectural details of the Marina Style residence (built in 1925), *and* all the comforts and convenience of modern construction.\n",

      "Perfect location! Convenient, quiet room in a shared apartment.  Please see our other listings for more reviews of the space. We just listed the room and it is still a bit of a work in progress, which is why it's such a good deal! Your room does not face the street, which makes things nice and quiet-- a real rarity in NYC. Natural light through your window is minimal, which is great for light-sensitive sleepers.  Our 2,200 sq ft apartment is up a couple flights of stairs and occupies the entire floor. It is shared between guests and your hosts. Interaction tends to be pretty minimal because everyone is busy doing his or her own thing in the city. I often go days at a time without seeing anyone else.  We keep the apartment as clean as we can, but please understand that it is an older building and shows its age. The occasional guest expecting a gleaming new hotel might take issue with this, but the vast majority of people are thrilled to book one of the best deals in NYC.\n",

      "*PRICE LOWERED FOR MAY AND JUNE  :)  Sleeps 4 guests - very peaceful Separate real bedroom Vibrant neighborhood, great walk score  First floor, easy stairs  Large bright bedroom, new queen sized bed/soft linens Fully renovated, new appliances Comfy full sized sleeper sofa in living room 2 blocks to subway  Restaurants, bars, shopping, quality groceries  No traffic noise in the apartment Chemical free/pet free home Good sized apartment with one bright closed bedroom (and new air conditioner) with comfy queen sized bed, open concept kitchen/dining/living room with a full (double) sized sleeper couch. The building is very well kept, and is about 100 years old and so it has hardwood floors, very warm radiators and the apartment has an amazing newly renovated bathroom and kitchen.   Hair straightener, blowdryer, clothing iron, and small ironing board are provided so you don't need to lug one around and waste space in your suitcase. All the neighbors know each other, and the place is extremely safe and quiet - not a party building. Normal noise/music/gatherings are welcome but 4am dance parties might not go over so well. The apartment is on the first floor but up a short flight of stairs when you first come in the building, so it is actually the second floor and so is super safe feeling. We are facing the back of the building and so there is little to no street noise - a rare find in New York City. Pa\n",

We adorned the walls and nooks with that which inspires us - the sixties, world art, music, antiques, classic pop culture, family heirlooms, forgotten one-of-a-kind treasures, things we've found and things we've made from scratch. We maintained and honored the history of this 20s film era bungalow where old film actors would actually stay while shooting for the budding film industry, and simultaneously gave it a modern, boho edge.  Each of the two bedrooms exudes it's own character and style, and on the practical end offers lots of storage space for your belongings. The front bedroom has its own walk-in closet and office nook area, and between the living room and bathr\n",

This is a classic tenement space with hardwood floors and tons of light -- the pictures don't due it justice as it's night-time and I'm in a hurry. This unit being in the back house means that it's acoustically shielded by surrounding buildings and therefore so quiet you won't believe you're in downtown Manhattan.\n",

My family said they would love to stay there longer if they are staying in the city. Highly recommend. JUNE 2014: Rachel & Family - Jon & Christine's place was amazing! Such a wonderful location, super safe neighborhood, and walking distance to GG park! The place was so clean and everything we needed was available for us to use. The beds were comfy and there is a lovely back patio/yard area with lots of natural light. It was a wonderful place to come home to after a day out and about exploring SF. Jon & Christine were super helpful whenever we had any questions and always responded in a timely fashion. We would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to any of our friends!

      "Our chic and comfortable one bedroom loft is unique with an old world Nola charm! Enjoy a spacious setting (1900 sq. ft.) with modern amenities. It comfortably fits four and is centrally located on a quiet street, just a few blocks from Magazine St. This building was an old firehouse built in the 1850's.  The walls are brick and there are two grand and dimmable chandeliers to add to the ambiance.  There are two bathrooms which have modern tiled floors and showers which compliment an old claw foot tub with some rust spots on it.  You can park your car on the side yard behind a manual gate or there is plenty of free street parking as well.  The unit sits atop a warehouse full of restaurant equipment on the ground floor.  We have a beloved organic breakfast restaurant only a mile away.  The furniture is very comfortable, but unfortunately one of the guests put a rip in the back of the couch.  We are looking into replacing that soon.  We have a professional company treat the place for bugs as well.  So, when you get this old you develop a few \"character\" traits, but the Rustic Firehouse will provide a memorable and unique setting for your stay.  Come on down, we would be happy to host you down here in New Orleans.\n",

This home is directly on the lake, and although it does not have a boat dock, there are boats available for tours next door (Austin's Boat Tours) and public ramp available close by. The house was laid out almost as if it were meant to be a rental house/hotel because every single room has its own glass sliding door that open to the balcony overlooking beautiful Lake Travis and the pool.  There are spiral staircases going down from each side of the house, as well as the indoor staircase and elevator. There is plenty of space for all the extra beds we have provided such as the 4 roll away mattresses and 4 blow up queens. There are also 2 futons and a sofa bed, besides the 2 kings and 4 queens in the bedrooms that are permanent.  The kitchen is great for cooking for large groups with the professional Viking oversized stove and the big Sub zero fridge. The view is the most impressive you can get of Lake Travis, with 360 views of the largest area and Starnes island. The house is also located on the south side of the lake, so you are much closer to downtown than almost any other Lakefront Travis home, approx 25 miles and very close to Lakeway shopping (10 min) and the Be\n",
