    " #\"I love my WeHo apartment. It's like a private oasis. Full of natural light and all the comfort you can ask for. The pool, a few steps away from the entrance door, is always clean and ready for you to jump in. The best  location for visitors to LA in the heart of West Hollywood. Within walking distance from all the trendy shops, bars, and restaurants and the famous Sunset strip. Parking on the street is readily available either in front of or within a block of my building with your personal parking permit.  You'll sleep in a private very comfortable  twin bed in a room with natural light and hardwood floor. You have plenty of space for your personal belongings.  Access to  a beautiful living room and a 62\"\" TV with  DVD player. You'll have connection to Netflix and high-speed WiFi. There is a full kitchen if you desire is to cook your own meals. Guests will share the full bathrooms equipped with fresh towels and toiletries at all times for your convenience.  The Neighborhood Is super safe and very well kept. There are a lot of great bars and restaurants within walking distance and guests with cars can easily find street parking. Getting Around There is a bus stop less than a block away, but i none This apartment is located in the midst of West Hollywood, close  to Museum row, walking distance to Melrose, the Sunset strip and two Farmers Market/ 5 min drive to the Grove,  to Beverly Hills, 5 min drive to the Hollywood district, 20 min to Venice Beach (depends on traffic), 20 min to Downtown (depends on traffic), 25 min drive to LAX (depends on traffic). You'll find it to be an urban Oasis. 20 minutes to DTLA and Silverlake and to recently remodeled Echo Park. Easy to get around by car to all of Los Angeles. Centrally located. Fantastic restaurants and cafes nearby.  If you have a car, then travel around Los Angeles is easy as the apartment is centrally located and highway access is pretty close.  You'll find it to be a convenient location to visit LA and suburbs. You will be steps away from everything!!! Whether your personality is party - calm - sporty- artsy or coffee -  you won't be disappointed with the area because everything is in front of your nose! :-) The Sunset strip is Like any apartment, hotel, hostel or AirBnB, the common area is shared, so be respectful of  that. Do your own dishes and don't leave your personal stuff lying around.  To protect all parties involved all bookings must be made through the Airbnb site. My guests get one key of the house and one key of their room, so they are free to come and go whenever they want. Access to the house is for paying guests only. You are not permitted to invite people to your room or to the house. Smoking is not permitted inside the house. Please treat the apartment as if it's your home, not a hotel. To make sharing comfortable for everyone, clean up after yourself and don't leave dishes in the sink :-) Please let me know if you break or stain anything, so it can be replaced in time for the following guests. Smoking is permitted around the pool area. Please don't leave cigarette or any kind of garbage around. No dogs or other animals are allowed in the apartment. Feel free to use any of my spices, and anyt Rent a car, take Uber, take the bus on Sunset, or simply walk around the neighborhood. Getting around is easy. There is Laundry in building located next to the apartment. The washer  cost 1.25 and the drying depends on how long you want to dry your clothes. Please have quarters  available. There is no change machine in the laundry room. If you feel like working out at home, there is a stationary bike at your disposal and a couple of small weights. I don't work a traditional 9-5 so some days I am home all morning or afternoon.  Other days I am gone most of the day. I have classes at UCLA a couple of evenings so I don't get home until after 10:00 pm. In the dining area, a huge table is used for eating and as a work desk when needed.  Some days I stay home working or I go work at the beautiful WeHo library down the street. It has a magnificent view of the Pacific Design Center and the Hollywood Hills. You can't do better than this for your personal office. I am a very easy-going but I do have a few  rules to make things easy: This is a non-smoking, non-vaping, non-drug, non-partying, quiet environment.  If you are coming to the city just for partying or late night life, I'm probably not the best choice. For everyone's safety, I ask that you not bring strangers into the property. The toilet can clog, please nothing foreign other than toilet paper down the toilet. Pets are not allowed in this place. I keep the wood floors very clean because I like to walk barefoot in the house.  You will find my home organized and clean. I appreciate you keeping the place in the same state you found it in. There are two different trash cans. One for recycling and one for normal trash. The bins are outside in front of the garage so if the trash is full please don't leave it in the house when you leave. It is 3 steps away :-) Thank you. I am about clean, quiet, happy co-existence, and very accommodating and respectful of your privacy. I hope to share my home\"\n",

      "BEFORE BOOKING: PRIVATE rental only, June to August. This is a lovely 1850 sq. ft. apartment/home in Uptown, New Orleans. It's a great place to relax...close to (URL HIDDEN) a great neighborhood. Please send a note, and inquire prior to booking. I invite you to come from June through early August. Note: prices vary based upon specific dates and length of stay. The pricing system is a bit weird in this app, so put in your individual dates to get your exact price, and let me know if you have any problems. Welcome! You'll be greeted with a bottle of wine, fresh flowers and a handy guide to use of the place and getting around in New Orleans. This is a quiet, beautiful and safe area of the city for your visit. The space is large (over 1800 sq. ft.) but I prefer no more than 2 people; we can set up a little bed in your room, if you're coming with a child, but this place is really ideal for a couple or solo traveler...and you'll have more than enough room. You'll be happy with the clean, air conditioned space, beautiful wood floors and cozy furnishings. none\n",

The house has a full kitchen, nice back deck, dining room, and a cozy living room with a television with HBO and Amazon Fire TV options.

There's plenty of parking in the driveway and in front of the house, but if you want to use UberX it costs about 17 to the airport and 9 to downtown. A note about head height- the ceilings in the bluebird are 7', and a little lower in the bathroom. If you are tall, I hope you will still consider staying, but know the ceilings and doorways are low.

North Park, Hillcrest, and Gaslamp are less than a 12 cab ride away or about 10 to 15 minutes driving Along with a private room, guest will have full access to my kitchen, bathroom, living room, patio, and awesome dog named Finn.    Our presence will be minimal in the house, but I am always available for my guest's needs and to grab a bite or drink around our area.  Note that the sweetest dog on the planet lives in this house, he will be around.   University Heights is hop, skip, and a jump from this apartment, this neighborhood offers vegetarian restaurants, late night burritos and tacos, Thai food, Mediterranean cuisine, a dance club, and bars. Normal Heights is in the hopping distance as well, this neighborhood is a key location for lovers of craft-beer and unique cocktails.  Also I recommend Black Horse coffee house for the best cup of Joe in San Diego.  Hillcrest is known as the gay district of SD, there is a wide variety of restaurants and bars in this neighborhood too.  North Park is the hippest hipster hood in all the land. :)   There are multiple bus stops 10 feet away from ou none\n",
