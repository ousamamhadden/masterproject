The `load_in_4bit` and `load_in_8bit` arguments are deprecated and will be removed in the future versions. Please, pass a `BitsAndBytesConfig` object in `quantization_config` argument instead.
`low_cpu_mem_usage` was None, now set to True since model is quantized.

You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1.47 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacty of 31.73 GiB of which 1.03 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 30.70 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 29.38 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 970.27 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management and PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF
