### happytransformer

When using happytransformer, it is necessary to have `grammar: ` at the beginning of the input sentence. This is because happytransformer uses the T5 model, which is a text-to-text model that can perform various natural language tasks by using different prefixes. For example, if you want to use the model for summarization, you need to add the prefix `summarize: ` before the input text. Similarly, if you want to use the model for grammar correction, you need to add the prefix `grammar: ` before the input sentence.

TTSettings class from the happytransformer library is used to control the text generation settings for the HappyTextToText model. The TTSettings class has several parameters that can be adjusted to change the behavior of the text generation algorithm. Here is what each parameter does:

**num_beams:** This parameter specifies the number of steps for each search path. A search path is a sequence of possible next words that are generated by the algorithm. The more beams there are, the more diverse and creative the output text will be, but also the longer it will take to generate.

**min_length:** This parameter specifies the minimum number of generated tokens. A token is a unit of text, such as a word or a punctuation mark. The minimum length ensures that the output text has at least some words, even if they are not grammatically correct or meaningful.

**max_length:** This parameter specifies the maximum number of generated tokens. The maximum length limits how long and complex the output text can be.
