I don't have any pets, but you're welcome to bring your own, as long as you're confident they'll behave themselves! Please just let me know in advance. none The flat is in Leith, a 2 minute walk away from the Ocean Terminal shopping centre and bus terminus. The Shore is also close - a 10 minute walk away, and has lots of great bars and restaurants in a lovely part of town. The water of Leith runs past the area, a 2 minute walk away from the flat. The flat is on the top floor of an old (B-listed) tenement building. I realise the price is quite high - this is just because I value my space and really only expect to take bookings during busy periods. For the sake of expectation management, based on feedback I've received, I'll also point out that due to the age of the building, the stair well isn't much to look at. It's tidy and everything - just old! Also, the guest bedroom does have curtains, but they still let in quite a lot of light in the mornings. Other than that, I'm sure you'll be very comfortable. I can recommend a very reliable local taxi company, but the bus connections are also very convenient. Being close to Ocean Terminal, the flat is: 1 minute walk to numbers 10 and 34 buses 2 minute walk to numbers 16, 22, 35 and 36 buses 4 minute walk to numbers 7, 14 and 21 buses There is also a free parking area next to the building. You'll have unlimited access to your double bedroom, hallway, bathroom, kitchen and dining/living room, although you'll be sharing all of these but the bedroom with me. Once you ""check in"" and get keys, you can come and go as you like, but if you want to ""check in"" during business hours, I'll need you to meet me at my office 10 minutes away. I work a 10 minute walk away from the flat, Mon-Fri 9am-5:30pm. I'll be available on my mobile in case of emergency, and will be around the flat most evenings/weekends. I'll probably mostly keep to myself, but I'll be available a lot of the time if you need anything, and am happy to help you get orientated and recommend good places to go for food/drinks etc. Come and go as you like - please just keep the noise down after 11pm (12 at weekends), clean up any kitchenware you use, don't bring anyone to the flat other than the agreed/booked guests, make sure the bathroom is free between 7:40-8am every week day, and generally try to be respectful of the place.",1

The room has a retro London theme, with a mixture of modern and antique pieces. There is a wardrobe, work table, Smart HD TV (including Netflix and Amazon Video), numerous books and a beautiful view over the rooftops of Notting Hill. The adjacent private bathroom is equipped with a shower, sink and toilet. As someone who travels frequently, I know the bed is the most important thing. The duvet and pillows are top quality faux down (suitable for those with allergies) and the sheets and towels white Egyptian cotton.

Also remember Uber works perfectly in London! London Underground trains The flat is a 7 minute walk from both Notting Hill Gate and Ladbroke Grove Underground stations. Notting Hill Gate is on the Central Line, which is perhaps the most fast line for all the main London sights, as well as the Circle and District lines, which run along the north bank of the Thames and are great for Westminster (for Big Ben) and Victoria Station. Ladbroke Grove is on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines, which give extremely quick access to Paddington, Baker Street, King's Cross St Pancras and the country's largest mall (Westfield) at Wood Lane. Buses The most useful local bus route in the 23 bus, which is 30 seconds from the door. It goes to Paddington Station and into Central London. It can be a great option, par Guests are welcome to use the spacious kitchen / dining area, whether to work, read, eat or watch television - as well as the toilet and outdoor terrace located on the same floor.

"Located close to many of Mount Dandenongs key tourist attractions and offering sweeping views out to Mount Martha and the south of the bay, the Fern Room is a bed/sitting room with separate European style kitchenette and a private bathroom. Our home of Bayview Ferny Creek is beautifully located on the cooler and greener, south facing side of the Dandenong Ranges, around 480 metres above sea level and enjoying uninterrupted sweeping views on the horizon from Chelsea, to Mount Martha and the southern end of Port Philip Bay and around to French Island and Western Port Bay. On a clear day the view is amazing and the beautiful night light are also a wonderful sight. Whether taking in the vast views across the horizon, or surrounded by a blanket of cloud, you will feel a hundred miles from everywhere in your private space; yet surprisingly everything you may want to experience in the Dandenong Ranges is a only a few minutes drive away.   Your accommodation will be in the Fern Room;  The Fern Room is a bed/sitting room with a very comfortable queen bed with pillow-top mattress, a 2-3 seat sofa, wardrobe, wall TV and free wi-fi. You have your own private bathroom with shower over bath. It also features a separate European style k none The Dandenong Ranges are a beautiful rainforest environment and a great place to visit at any time of year (although it can be decidedly cold in winter). If you are a walking enthusiast there are numerous tracks & trails to explore all within a short walk or a short drive from your base in Ferny Creek. Here are just a few activities you might want to consider if time is limited: Sherbrooke Falls Walk - A gentle 40 minute round-trip walk in the Sherbrooke Forest and you won't need the car as it is accessible as a short walk from your base in Ferny Creek. The 1000 Steps : Kokoda Memorial Walk  A hugely popular activity with thousands of visitors every week. Be different, start from the top where parking is plentiful, walk down the steps and then up. National Rhododendron Gardens  Beautiful to visit at any time of year. Sassafras (4 km away) or Olinda (7 km away)  Either township is only a few minutes drive and they are waiting for you to explore with many excellent cafes & restaurants Additional Guest Information - The Fern Room is an ideal getaway for two people but if necessary can also accommodate a toddler or child.  We can supply a portable cot but please bring your own bedding. It is possible for us to add a bed for a child up to 14 years if you are staying more than one night - but please enquire first before confirming your booking and select ""extra guest"" Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate three adults. If you have two children, please advise us of your situation and we will see if we can help. Pets  Well behaved dogs are more than welcome. Please select ""extra guest"" or ""3 guests"" if you are bringing your best mate as there is a small surcharge to cover extra cleaning costs. Please note that the garden area around the Fern Room is not fenced although you will be over 100 metres away from the nearest road. You will not be able to take your dog into most of the National Parks but there are a few Parks and some Gardens where dogs are allowed on a lead and If coming by public transport check Public Transport Victoria home page. The nearest bus stop to us is Mt. Dandenong Tourist Rd/Old Main Rd (Ferny Creek). From the bus stop we are a 150 mt walk. Unfortunately the bus and train timetables do not co-ordinate well but that neednt deter you; if you are coming by train we will be happy to pick you up from Upper Ferntree Gully railway station which is only a 5 minute drive away. If you are planning on visiting the sights more than a few km away from the Fern Room we strongly recommend that you come by car.  Undercover parking is available. We are not in any township however there is a general store/post office about 800 mt away for basic needs (including alcohol),  and major shops/supermarkets are only a few minutes away by car. The Garden You are welcome to walk around the garden if you wish.  It is always a work-in-progress but you will find there are slightly different horizon views from different areas of the garden. Chill Out Room While the Fern Room is a good sized room to sit or watch TV, you are not restricted to your bedroom suite when you stay at Bayview. You can also enjoy access to our large Chill Out Room - which is our TV / music room.  You need to enter our house to access the Chill Out Room, and obviously we might be there, but you are welcome to come in so don't be too shy.   We have a small library, TV access with every Foxtel channel and unlimited music from the internet music centre.  (Foxtel TV excludes pay per view). If we have the TV on we are usually watching football, smooth music or a foreign language movie ... feel free to suggest something else if you have a favourite show you are missing. In winter you can warm up and enjoy the ambiance of a wood fire.  In summer it is the coolest For a long time, we have maintained a simple but very powerful philosophy         Treat others the way they want to be treated In practical terms that means if you come to Bayview for a quiet time we will leave you in privacy. If you want to be sociable, whether its a relaxing chat or a more serious conversation, we have enough life experiences to share and well be happy to engage with you. That is the Bayview philosophy.  We wont impose on you, but we will respond to your needs. We want you to leave the Dandenong Ranges having accomplished exactly what you came for, and perhaps having enjoyed yourself just a little bit more than expected because you chose to stay at Bayview. A small word of warning ... we share our lives with an energetic labrador (Maudie) who will probably want to greet you whenever you come and go as you will need to pass through the main garden which is her domain.  If you give her any attention she will love you.  If you ignore her she will get the message and There are only three that really count: 1. No smoking in the Fern Room or Chill Out Room and if you smoke outside please remember (a) we are in a bush fire zone and (b) butts are not mulch for the garden! 2. We have a low tolerance of ageism, racism, sexism and most other 'ism's'. Swearing is quite acceptable. 3. Life in the hills' is usually pretty relaxing and enjoyable and we hope your visit is also.",2

"This gorgeous 3-bedroom apartment is directly across the road from the beach. It's very light, beautifully decorated and all within minutes of Bondi, Bronte, restaurants, shops and buses to the CBD. Watch the waves as you have a drink on the balcony. Here are a few of the highlights of The BEACHFRONT Apartment: THE APARTMENT The building only has 7 apartments in total. Your new neighbours are lovely. They all enjoy spending time at the beach and they are mature enough to avoid late nights and loud parties so you won't be disturbed. THE BALCONY It wraps around the front of the building and gives you a huge entertaining space. From the balcony you stare straight at the water and out to the horizon. It's stunning! INTERNALLY We have furnished the apartment using light and bright colours to capture all of the sun that pours into the rooms throughout the day. There are three different eating areas - the dining table, the breakfast bar with views out to the beach and an outdoor table and chairs (where you'll probably spend most of your time) ENTERTAINMENT If you want to, you can sit inside and watch the huge 54"" TV and use the DVD player or you can walk to Bondi and watch some real life entertainment at any one of the bars, clubs or live none Tamarama is the younger, arguably prettier, sister to Bondi Beach. It's a relatively quiet beach where locals spend hours bathing in the sun. There is a park here with BBQs, toilets, changing rooms and a large grassy area to make a picnic. GREAT OCEAN WALK While you're in the area, you must take the Great Ocean Walk. It's a pathway that hugs the coast line all the way from Bondi to Coogee beach. Thankfully, it crosses your doorstep. Just join the throngs of people making the pilgrimage every day. SCULPTURES BY THE SEA Every year artists erect a series of sculptures along the Great Ocean Walk. It's a magical display set against the ocean views along the walk and it attracts thousands of local people and others from around the world. This year it is happening from 24 October - 10 November. FREE BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE We want you to have a great time when you stay at our place. We like the idea of you sitting out on the balcony celebrating something and admiring the view. So, anyone that books for 3 nights or more will find a bottle of Veuve Cliquot in the fridge upon arrival. SAVING LIVES We are really thankful to live by the beach and it's a stunning beach. One of the things that makes this beach a great place to swim and have fun in summer are the lifesavers who volunteer their time to look after the people who use the beach. Chances are that you've chosen our place partly because of the beach out the front. So to thank the guys that look after the beach for us, 10% of everything that you pay to us will be given to them as a donation. It's the least we can do for the guys that keep the beach safe. We'll send you a copy of the receipt and any comments that we get from them in thanks. BUSES The local area is serviced by buses that will take you to other transport hubs that will take you anywhere you need to go or you can catch a local bus directly to the CBD and be there in about 15 minutes. You'll have access to the internet from the computer set up for you in the apartment. Just either call 131500 and ask them for help or search 131500 on a search engine and you'll find a website showing all the timetables. You're not too far from anywhere! All guests will have free access to all the amenities and facilities in the Apartment. This includes a coffee machine, dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, 434 litre fridge, a complete library of books, 54"" TV & DVD Player, wireless broadband internet, sound system and an intercom / security system. TRANSPORT Once you arrive at The BEACHFRONT Apartment you probably won't want to leave. But should the need arise, there is transport immediately out the front. The #361 bus stop is across the ride and it will take you to Bondi Junction or Bondi Beach. From the Junction you can catch buses and trains to the city. The bus is handy, however, most things are within walking distance anyway. Unfortunately, we don't get to meet the guests. We leave keys outside in a 'lockbox' which allows you to collect them whenever you arrive. We usually stay nearby and are available in the event that you need help with anything. Please be mindful of our neighbours and leave our home as you found it :)",3

"Welcome to our apartment in the heart of the historical Parisian neighborhood Le Marais.  Our cozy mansard-flat is in an historical building that dates back to the XVIII Century, with an elegant courtyard.

A nice view on the roofs, featuring Notre Dame and Panthon on the skyline, or a warm bath might help, too. The apartment has two rooms. You will have your own room, with dressing and heating. The flat is kind of all, but features everything needed. none Le Marais is a fairytale from the Middle Age Century, and stayed almost the same from that. There's nothing much to say about that: you might have already heard about its streets, its shops, its classy restaurants and typical bistrot, its unique atmosphere. It's so lively you will find many different shops and moods - la Perle Caf, right under our house, is intellectual and social. Clothing boutiques range from Supreme, a few meters away, a street clothing company, and Sandro, the most typical Parisian girl brand. The apartment is super central, which means that it is a few steps away from some of the highlights of the city (Cathedral, Hotel de Ville, BHV Marais...) and I will be more than happy to give you any tip on not-to-miss hidden attractions. @ It's very practical for everyone travelling. You will be in Chatelet in about 10 mins by walking, 5 minutes by metro, which is useful if you have a plane to catch.

To help the quietness of our neighbors, the aim is to stay in the court the less possible, do as less noise as possible and call me for any problem it might occour.",3

She is pretty independent and spends a lot of time outside. Please, just fill her bowl with food, and make sure she has some water in her dishes. Leave the window ajar for her, or make sure she's in if you would like to close it at night. Feel free to coax her in with treats, or just to get on friendly terms.",1

"My home is on top of a hill overlooking downtown.  For the time being (they are talking about moving soon) I am the first house to the left of the Hope Gallery which is one of the last remaining, sanctioned, graffiti parks in the country! This home has a large, young, energetic dog and an adorable cat so if you have allergies or a fear of large animals, this might not be the space for you. This is an awesome 3 bedroom home where we rent out two of the bedrooms and I live in the third bedroom. Each room rents individually so there is a good chance you'll run into other guest staying across the hall. You'll also get to meet my young, very energetic, dog, Tillie and my adorable and sweet cat, Edie. If you have allergies or fear large and excitable animals (Tillie is a big puppy), this probably isn't the space for you. I apologize for being redundant, but just to be clear - this is a shared space and there will likely be other travelers at the home during your stay! Please be prepared to share the bathroom and common areas of the home. Is this room not available for your dates? Check to see if my other room is available: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12916775 none This house is literally next door to the Hope Gallery, one of the last remaining sanctioned graffiti parks in the country. It's an amazing display of street art that is a sight to see! Don't let all of the people scare you away, the place generally calms down after dark with only a few stragglers throughout the evening. I'm also within walking distance from some great restaurants and Whole Foods (who doesn't love that place?) as well as about 10 blocks from the Lady Bird Lake where you can rent kayaks, canoes and stand-up paddle boards! Again, just want to reiterate that there is a large, very young, very active dog and cat that spends a lot of time in doors. Please do not book if you either don't like them, or have severe enough allergies that it will effect your stay in a negative way. I want my guests happy with their experience and itchy eyes will not help! Getting around this part of town is simple, if you drove - cool, you know what to do! If you didn't or would rather not... here are some options! Ride Austin, Get Me, Fare, and Fasten are our current ride share program. They function the exact same as Uber or Lyft if you're familiar. I could suggest Googling what the current promo codes are because you can often find up codes for to 50% off (they change all the time or else I would list them here). You are also located right off Lamar Blvd., a major street in Austin. Going North or South can take you to some interesting places and there is a bus that will pick you up and take you quite a ways in either direction! The Austin Capital Metro website (they also have an app) can help you get where you want to go! If you aren't driving (and using the driveway) please be prepared to walk up quite a large amount of  steep steps to get into the house. If you drive up the driveway, it's not big deal! Just something to be aware of... You'll have access to your room (obviously) as well as a shared bathroom (if there are guests staying in the other room, otherwise it's all yours). My kitchen is open to you and feel free to make coffee whenever you'd like! Also feel free to enjoy my front patio where there is an outdoor dining table and patio furniture! Make yourself at home! The laundry machines are located in my private bathroom but if you need to wash some things, just let me know and I will be more than happy to show you where it is as well as provide you with soap, bleach, and dryer sheets! I may not be physically present much as I work a lot but I am always available via phone/text or Airbnb message! Please reach out with any questions at ANY TIME! - - Absolutely no smoking inside the house whatsoever. There is a front patio area for this purpose.  - - No unapproved guests on the property. I'm not opposed to you having guests, but all guests MUST be approved by me before they arrive. - - This seems like a no-brainer, but NO occupying any other bedroom other than the one you reserved.  Otherwise, enjoy the space as if it's yours, and let me know if you need anything!",3

"Just 30 seconds walk from the city's main square and airport bus, and two minutes walk from the infamous La Rambla, this trendy 2nd floor home is packed with personality and tucked away down a quiet, safe and historic backstreet. The adjustable room is perfect for a either a couple or two friends, and the apartment has classic Gothic architectural features but with brand-new modern facilities and plenty of communal space. Simply unbeatable in location - you really are in the heart of Barcelona! The apartment has been custom decorated with hand-made furniture from locally-sourced salvaged and recycled materials. The high oak-beamed ceilings add to the overall ambiance, and there are two balconies to enjoy. I even have a small bar in the living area, which you are free to use as you please, so long as you are considerate to my other guests. none I live in Barcelona's most famous neighborhood, the Gothic quarter, and on one of the city's oldest and mysterious streets, which is notorious for it's fabled history and links to sorcery and cult practices. It's a remarkably quiet and safe area considering just how close it is to all the action, with the main shopping street one minute on foot, and some of Barcelona's top restaurants and bars within a stone's throw as well. There's a 24-hour supermarket around the corner, bike rental next door, and most of the main tourist sites can be easily reached on foot. It's a good mix of locals and expats living in this area and whilst not completely off the tourist map it still offers a real taste of Catalan culture and isn't swamped with flashing cameras. The apartment has three bedrooms in total; this one will be yours, another is my own, and the third will likely either empty, being gifted to a visiting friend, or listed on Airbnb - you'll see it on the map next this listing, or on my profile, so feel free to book either, or both. Unbelievably well-located; we're just 30 seconds walk from Placa de Calatunya, which is the city's best connected transport hub. There are multiple metro lines, two types of train, buses in every direction, a taxi rank, and the airport bus, which leaves every few minutes and is the most popular and most convenient way to travel to the airport - you can literally see our street when you step off the Aerobus ; ) There is access for all to kitchen and laundry facilities and of course free Wi-Fi. I have a lot of food basics like pasta, rice, milk, bottled water, etc, which you can help yourself to if you like and don't have to buy. I've also been collecting a hoard of maps and pamphlets for nearby restaurants and attractions that you can use and even keep. I work as a chef and love to cook for other people, and I always make way too much food anyway. I like very much to hang out with and get to know my guests, but I also know when to give space and I'm happy to leave you to enjoy your time together too : )  I'm always available by telephone, messaging, or a knock on my door, and happy to answer any questions at any time. Generally speaking this is nice house to hang out in, cook together and maybe share a glass of wine, but it's not a party house, and whilst it's very normal for my guest to enjoy the Barcelona nightlife, we don't host after-parties here, or pump music until daybreak. Smokers are welcome but should use the balconies out of respect for others who don't smoke. This includes in the bedrooms too unfortunately. Sorry guys. And remember we have nice neighbors above and below too, so try not to chat too loudly out there late at night. Also, as with any major hotel, bringing back strangers and random hook-ups is not allowed. It's a safety thing, and after all, this is my home and I have to live here too. Again, it's mainly out of respect for others with whom you share the same communal spaces. If you want to have friends over, just ask, and I'll probably say yes : ) My neighbors are cool too, and will say hello for sure, and they don't mind people coming and going either, so long as they are fr",3

Please make sure that you and your party will respect this. No smoking inside. Otherwise, enjoy! One more thing: in order to use the hot tub or the power burner in the outdoor kitchen, we should meet in person. It's really easy but needs some instructions. I'm generally around.",0

"Located in the Saint-Sauveur neighbourhood, my appartment is a few minutes walk to a microbrewery, many great restaurants & bars, a grocery store, a drugstore, and many other services. Close to the Old Quebec & many important tourist attractions, my district is the best one to live in, if you're looking for a unique and local experience. Also, free parking is easy to find on my street, and the bus station is just around the corner.  Ideal for couples, or solo travellers. You'll enjoy the quietness, the comfort, and the great luminosity of my appartment. And it's got anything you need to truly feel at home. The neighbourhood is unique, and close to everything. It's a small block of apparments, with three levels and 5 flats. There is no elevator. I live on the second floor and have very respectful neighbours. That's why I expect future guests to be just as respectful, and not make too much noise at night. none My neighbourhood is very unique. Many great local spots have settled down in the area, and places, like the Jos Dion tavern, open since 1933, have existed for a very long time. Every saturday during summer, there's a nice outdoor market, selling products from local farmers, settling down in the park right next to my place. And if you walk 10 minutes, you'll get in the Saint-Roch district, where you'll find many many bars, shops and restaurants, a public libary and a public pool. You can also walk up one of the many outdoor stairs, leading to the upper town and discover the Saint-Jean Baptiste district, or the Montcalm area. @ Parking is very easy on my street. Plus, there are no meters or time limit.  Around the block is a bus station, taking you to the Saint Roch neighbourhood, the train station, the Old Port & the ferry. You can transfer easily if you want to go to the upper town, the Old Quebec, or Sainte-Foy.  Nearby is also a cycling lane, that follows the Saint-Charles river, and will take you to the Montmorency falls, if you ride 13 km. It's about a 45 minutes ride.  It's very pretty, and not too hard! You'll have access to everything, from the washing machine & the dryer, to the espresso machine and juicer, if you feel like using them. All I ask from you is to treat my flat as if it was yours, and put everything back in its place before you leave :) You'll have the whole appartment to yourself, but you can reach me on my cell phone whenever you feel like something is missing, or if you have any problems, or questions. If we get the chance to meet upon your arrival, I'll make sure to show you my place around. If I can't meet you, I'll make sure you easily get a hold of the keys. - **L'appartement est au deuxime tage**",2

"Our lovely two-bedroom, plus attic, Victorian terrace house is in the heart of Brunswick, only 15 minutes from the city centre by tram, train or bike path. It is extremely close to the University of Melbourne precinct, as well as Princes & Royal Parks. Our typical Brunswick home offers two main bedrooms with very comfortable Queen sized beds (wool underlays), plus an attic room with twin beds (up a steep set of pull-down stairs  so best for younger, but not too young guests!), a large dining room, lounge (with a comfortable and large couch that can be used as another bed) and a sunny kitchen & bathroom. It has heating, cooling, double glazed windows and a heap of insulation, ensuring that it is comfortable all year round.  Our lovely kitchen and dining rooms are set up for cooking and entertaining (although, being Brunswick you never need to cook if you don't want to!). Just as an example, here is a recent review of some of the eating options in Brunswick: (URL HIDDEN) Our house is very family friendly. We can supply a high chair and baby bath should you need it, and childrens books, games and toys if you let us know in advance.

If you like your coffee house-roasted and your breakfasts big, healthy, innovative and tasty, Brunswick is the place. Similarly, if you value pubs with fantastic live music and beer gardens, Brunswick has it all. While our pad is a quiet and peaceful oasis, you are only a short walk to all the action, including Barkly Square shopping centre. At the same time, peace and serenity is at your doorstep in the form of two large parks: Princes and Royal Park. This allows for plenty of play and exercise. You are also close to the city centre, Carlton and Fitzroy  areas Melbourne is also renowned for. We love our home, but now live at the coast, so our house is available for AirBnB guests to enjoy. We travel often and always use AirBnB ourselves, so we know what guests need to make their stays enjoyable. We have fantastic neighbours and the community feel of Brunswick is enviable. We live in a street with young people, old people and many families. If you enjoy feeling part of a city and its fabric, rather than just being a visitor, then you'll love our home! We are only two minutes walk to Jewell train station for the Upfield line train (into the city via the zoo), Sydney Road trams (number 19 into the city via the Queen Victoria Market), Brunswick road buses and the Upfield and Capital City bike trails. We are walking distance or a short tram/bike ride to The University of Melbourne and its precinct. You will have the house and courtyard completely to yourself; however, we are in easy reach by phone should you need anything. @ Treat our house as you would treat your own home. It's fine to entertain guests, but no loud parties please. Unfortunately we can't accommodate pets except under exceptional circumstances. Smoking outside is ok. Please leave the house as you found it, with dishes cleaned and put away. Thank you!",3

My place is also 10-15 minutes from San Diego's best beaches, including Pacific Beach, Mission Beach, La Jolla and Del Mar. The best part is that to get to the closest beach (Pacific Beach), you just take Diamond (the street the apartment is on), and follow it to the beach. No turns.  Sea World and the San Diego Zoo are both 10 minutes away.  Balboa Park is 15 minutes away, and the Gaslamp District and Petco Park (San Diego Padres) are about 10 minutes away. Basically, I'm about 10-15 minutes from almost any place you might want to visit in San Diego as well as the airport! Legoland in Carlsbad is a 30 minute drive. My apartment is stocked with regular toiletries, towels, blankets, and just about anything you may need for cooking. Feel free to park in my driveway. I do share it with one other person, so just don't park behind anyone, so as not to  block them in. There is almost always parking on Olney street, which intersects with Diamond St. It's only a block from my place. There is a beach cruiser bicycle available for guest use if you'd like. There is also a bicycle shop called PB Bikes within a 2 minute walk of the apartment in the Vons Plaza. It's 10 for the entire day! Also, Uber is incredibly fast and reliable in this area. Ubers show up after you send the request, no joke, within 2-3 minutes!  The main highway I-5 is 2 minutes away.  The Amtrak station and airport are both 10 minutes away as well. The entire apartment is accessible minus my bedroom, which is the one furthest from the bathroom. I'm always available by call or text and usually within a 10 minute drive if you need anything. Also, my best friend DJ will show ya where to park, where to eat and drink, and can help you with anything you need! I don't have many rules. You'll notice that there's no cleaning fee and the deposit is low. I want to keep it that way.   All I ask is that you clean up after yourself and don't damage or attempt to steal my stuff. Leave the stuff in my bedroom alone other than the bed and desk. Put everything else in the apartment back where you found it when you're done with it. Put food down the garbage disposal so as not to attract flies. Lock up and turn out the lights and the TV off when you leave. Dogs are allowed as long as they are ""potty trained"". If on the extremely rare chance they have an accident, all I ask is that you clean it up and remove the stain. I'm partially allergic to cats so I'd prefer they weren't in the apartment, but it's not a deal breaker for me, so just ask first.  No smoking TOBACCO in the house as it leaves a stench.  Basically, LEAVE THE PLACE LIKE IT WAS WHEN YOU ARRIVED",3

My house is in the middle of everything in bustling St Kilda East but the living area and master bedrooms are set at the back of the house so it's also very private and very quiet. none St Kilda East or Balaclava is in the heart of everything that is fantastic about Melbourne.

"Our simple little spare room is available for short and long term stays. Comes with garden view, comfy bed, desk and privacy. Sharing the house with myself and partner Joel, and our pets, the seductive cat: Raul Maria and the grumpy mini dachshund Hans.. Lovely kitchen, bathroom (shared) and living area, and right next to Moreland train station. We try our best to be considerate hosts full of lots of helpful tips on the area. The room is a calm and simple space/ small yet sweet. Comes with a king single bed, large desk, side table and a couple of plants to keep you company. We would love to squeeze in a wardrobe but haven't quite worked out how it will fit yet : / The room is right at the back of the house and looks out onto the garden. Lot's of privacy. During winter we have a oil heater to heat the space, and a hot water bottle to keep the bed warm, we have been told the space gets nice and cosy - ideal for some netflix watching in bed. If you have large suitcases and are worried about space please let us know if you would like to store any items elsewhere in the house to make the space larger : ) none My house is located in Coburg, right on the border of Brunswick. Both towns have loads of character and amazing food and bars. You are likely to get addicted to zataar pizzas and halloumi pies whilst you are here! There are lots of treasures located right on your doorstep - especially Gervasi, a great Italian supermarket. My favourite coffee shop is also just a 5 min walk down the road, Wild Timor, which sells organic coffee direct from farmers in Timor. The house comes with a dog, the small and cute Dachshund Hans. Hans is scared of strangers and is a bit anti social. His pretty face is best appreciated from afar. The cat Raul Maria keeps to herself, generally towards the front of the house. She has been known to pretend that she is being starved in attempt to get guests to feed her ; ) As this is a home and not a b'n'b business please note that there are no daily cleaners to clean and pick up after you. The house will be in a normal clean and tidy state, but as it is an old house it will always look a little rough around the edges. For longer stays of more than 2 weeks I can arrange a mid stay clean for an extra cleaning fee. One previous guest mentioned that you can hear the train from the house sometimes. This is true as we are very close to the train station, but as they mentioned, we find that it doesn't bother anyone very much. The house is a 2 min walk from Sydney road with frequent trams, and a 30 sec walk to Moreland train station. There is also a bike path that runs to the city right outside my house. The ride takes about 30 mins. Thornbury and Northcote are also easy to get to with a bus just around the corner getting you there is 15 mins. You are welcome to use the kitchen, bathroom, laundry facilities, lounge area and the backyard. Though the backyard is where my dog lives, who is old and grumpy, so you may wish to leave him to go about his business. The bathroom is shared. I work full time and Joel is studying. We're often home in the evenings to cook dinner etc. I'm happy to hang out, share cooking/ a bottle of wine whist you're here, or give you all the local hot tips. Otherwise if you would like to keep to yourself that's fine too! I like to be friendly to the environment by conserving energy and water. So please be mindful when using electricity and having showers etc. No smoking inside. No unexpected guests. This is my home so please be considerate and respectful.",2

"My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers who need somewhere nice and clean to stay. Ideal for someone with a car as there is plenty of street parking available. My home is located in the Bronzeville neighborhood. 10-15 ride to downtown :) The home is beautiful with stainless steel appliances, granite counters and washer & dryer for your convenience. There is a 32"" tv in your room and a 55"" tv in the living room that you have access to. The bed inside your room is actually a futon from ikea. It's a little bigger than a double but smaller than a queen. It's really comfortable. Towels, toilette paper & paper towel are in the linen closet... Use whatever you need. My hubby and I may or may not be home, but if we are we will pretty much be in our bedroom to give you as much privacy as possible. There is central air and heat. It does make a little noise and it is not silent. I haven't had any complaints, but just giving you a heads up. none I like the neighborhood because there is plenty of street parking and it's relatively quiet. It's about a 10-15 min drive to the downtown core. Another reason why I recommend having a car is because there aren't very many shops or stores near the house. The house is across the street from a school that's no longer in use that is being renovated to be a private school. If you don't mind not being right in the downtown core then this is a good spot for you. Neighbors are super easy going. Occasionally you may need to check in or out without me. This will depend on my work schedule. I will provide you with instructions if this is the case. There is the green line about 5 mins walking (or less) from the house. I do not personally take the train here in Chicago... This is Chicago so I always recommend having a vehicle just to be safe. If you are coming from another major city (New York, Toronto, Houston etc...) then you should be fine, otherwise some people may be uncomfortable. Just being honest. Guests will have access to the entire unit except 1 bedroom (which is my bedroom). The unit is actually a 2 bedroom apt, and I so live there. My bedroom will be the only part of the house you don't have access to. You will have access to the living room, second bedroom, bathroom and any other space in the house is yours to enjoy. I will interact with guests as much as they need me to. Anything you need we are there for you! No extra guests. 2 max.  Since I do live here, I'd just like my guests to just respect my house. But, hey... You are on vacation so enjoy :)",2

With queen bed, full-size fold-out couch, and cot-size fold-out loveseat, you could fit 5 adults, but it would be pretty cozy (cramped).  The space is about 400 sq ft, so more comfortable for up to a two adults and a child or two, depending on how small. You can make your own coffee and tea, there's a fridge, and basic cooking equipment. The full bathroom has a deep soaking tub.  Towels, sheets, pillows, blankets and quilts are included. There is a space heater which takes a minute to get to temperature, but can be left on and heats up the well-insulated space nicely. There is no TV.  There is wifi, and a solar-powered blue-tooth enabled speaker. none Our neighborhood is a little off the beaten path, and was practically unknown 10 years ago.  Now, the area is increasingly popular with young families who enjoy the small Victorian houses with yards, the views, and the friendliness of the area.  Our block is a mix of renters, owners, adults, families, people who have been here a few years and people who have been here for a few generations. Right around the corner on Mission Street is a Little El Salvador, with pupuserias (if you haven't tried a pupusa, we recommend it!), bakeries, and other restuarants and shops.  There is also a nice local coffee shop, convenience stores, and neighborhood bars. Our block ends at Holly Park on the hilltop, with basketball courts, tennis courts, places to grill, and a good sized kids' playground.   Around the bend from Holly Park is Cortland Ave., the main street of Bernal Heights, with coffee shops, wine bars, a gallery, several restaurants, a couple neighborhood bars, and full-service grocery store, STR-(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN).  Possession of a San Francisco Short-Term Rental Registration Certificate certifies that the registration certficiate holder has agreed to comply with the terms of the San Francisco Short-Term Residential Rental ordinance (San Francsico Administrative Code Section 41A.)  This ordinance does not require an inspeciton of the unit by the City for potential Building, Housing, Fire, or other Code violations. To make getting around the city easy, we provide Clipper Cards, pre-loaded with cash value on the honor system.   They are good for all area transit, and give you a discount on the ferries.  This is on an honor system and we ask that you replenish the value you use. It's about a 20-minute walk to the hip part of the Mission District, or there's a bus stop at the end of our block.  The 14 and 49 stop there, and take you right to the Mission District and downtown.  Go a couple blocks up Mission St. to catch the 14R for a faster ride to downtown. Parking is generally easy during the day, but in the evening and later and night it gets tighter.  Pay attention to street cleaning signs.  We are a couple minutes' drive from freeway on-ramps for 101 and 280, so there's very quick access to the Peninsula. You have your own locked entrance, and there is coin-operated laundry accross the patio from the cottage.  You are welcome to our laundry detergent, which is stored on the shelf above the machines, all the way to the left (the stuff on the right belongs to our upstairs neighbors).  If our truck is gone when you arrive, you're welcome to use the driveway to unload, but otherwise there is street parking.  Please check signage for street cleaning. @ Smoking allowed outdoors only.  There's a comfy patio for your relaxation. We have a simple Weber grill and charcoal, let us know if you'd like to use it and we can make sure you're set up. The room is perfect for 1 or 2 adults, and 1 child.  To use all the fold-out capacity, you could squeeze 5 adults (2 sharing a queen bed, 2 sharing the full fold-out couch, 1 on the fold-out loveseat).  It would be quite cozy (or cramped). Please don't hesitate to let us know if anything breaks or is broken or needs fixing, so we can address it promptly. Please keep it quiet outside between 9 PM and 8 AM - it's a quiet neighborhood, and we live on the other side of the patio.  However, the cottage itself is well insulated for sound - so if you're inside with closed windows, sound won't travel much.",3

If Laird's Lodge is booked, why not have a look at our other holiday flat in the same building, Lady's Lodge, also on Airbnb. Edinburgh Castle, Scotland's best known landmark, is your neighbour. The sounds of knights jousting and horses clopping through the street are long gone and are now replaced by the buzz and vibrancy of Edinburgh's history-soaked and fun-filled Old Town.

The setting is wonderfully striking; the city is perched on a series of extinct volcanoes and rocky crags which rise from the generally flat landscape of the Lothians, with the sheltered shoreline of the Firth of Forth to the north. Edinburgh Castle dominates the city-centre skyline and from its ramparts you can look down on medieval lanes and elegant, sweeping terraces that hold over a thousand years of history, mystery and tradition. Yet you will also see a modern, dynamic capital where international festivals attract the world's leading performers, galleries display cutting-edge art, and bars, restaurants and clubs create a lively, cosmopolitan atmosphere with a distinctly Scottish twist. We operate a key lockbox system.  While they can be awkward to use, we find our guests prefer that to a fixed 2 hour arrival time window.  It offers much greater flexibility and if you are late arriving, you don't need to worry, just let yourself in and start your holiday.

From Edinburgh airport, you can take the tram or the airport bus to Princes Street.  The journey takes about 40 mins.

"This is a private, spacious bedroom in a clean, friendly apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Double bed, plenty of space, welcome access to the living room, kitchen, and full shared bath. Close to great bakeries, parks, & subway (1 line). I adore my little Upper West Side apartment and would love to have you for a visit!  It's a clean, comfortable haven in Manhattan.  It would be a lovely place to stay, either while you're on vacation, or as a jumping-off point for a move to NYC. The available bedroom is cozy but spacious and fine for two people.  My roommate will be on vacation, so she and I decided to rent her room for the week while she is away. (She doesn't have a lot of ""stuff"" so you'll have plenty of space. She's also fully on board with the plan.:)) I'd love to have someone come stay with me for a few days or longer!  We're on the 4th floor of a walk-up, and the apartment faces away from the street, so it's very nice and quiet. none We're close to some fantastic bakeries and restaurants, all literally within a couple of blocks. There's a great beer garden a block away. Grocery stores every few blocks, including a 24-hour grocery store right by the subway, which is just around the corner. Riverside Park is about a 5 minute walk in one direction, and Central Park is about 5 minutes in the other.  The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is one of my favorite places in New York, and it's only 6 blocks away -- a short little walk to some gorgeous architecture, stunning gardens, and even a pair of strutting peacocks that will make it hard to believe you're in the middle of Manhattan. I have an adorable  dog, a Maltese. (You can see her in one of the pictures.) She's very friendly and lovely -- as well as hypoallergenic and nonshedding. The 1 train is one of the most reliable train lines, and it runs up and down the West side of Manhattan. It will get you to downtown or midtown in no more than 20 minutes. We're also a short walk away from the B & C trains, and buses are also convenient. (Most convenient airport by public transportation or cab is LGA, but I use all three airports -- LGA, EWR, and JFK.) You'll have a private bedroom, plus access to the living room (couch, TV with Netflix, Amazon Prime & HBO), kitchen, and bathroom. The apartment has one bathroom, which you'll be sharing with me. I will also be staying in the apartment, in a second bedroom of course. You'll have plenty of privacy if desired, but are more than welcome to share the common spaces. I'll be easily accessible if you need anything during your stay, and will be happy to give you tips and ideas for your visit or move to New York or help with any questions about the apartment. But I'm also happy to give you as much privacy as you'd like. I work during the day and get home in the evening, so you will have the place to yourself quite a bit. I ask that you please treat my home as your home while you're here. Please no parties or smoking, be respectful of food/crumbs in the bedroom, and just clean up after yourself in the kitchen and living room, etc.",0

Vienna is offering a lot of opportunity not being bored and I'll do my best to help with anything I can. @ City Airport Train CAT costs 11 EUR/person for one direction. In just 16min to the apartment you are at Wien Mitte/Landstrae and you need from there (with U3 to Westbahnhof, 5 min walk) around 20min.  (URL HIDDEN) The other option is to use the train Nr.7 (S-Bahn). It is more cheaper but you need around 50min to the city. I suggest to use the application qando Wien to find your way around using public transportation. Are you coming with a car? U3 tube (last Station Erdberg) leads you directly to Park & Ride Garage  (EUR 3.40/day and EUR 17.10/week) (URL HIDDEN) @ @ Smoking and candles in the apartment are prohibited and no pets are allowed. Treat the place as it is your own, take care to be clean and be quiet after  10 pm in order not disturbing the neighbours. I will ask you not to download anything from illegal or suspicious sites (e.g. films, songs, games) as I can have a problem and I will appreciate it if you don't walk with your street shoes in the apartment. Check-in  during the weekend is flexible. Thanks.",2
"Large room in enormous flat, great area in the heart of Gracia, great communication, I can guarantee a great stay for anyone who decides to come! Large double room, with double windows, lots of light and very clean! This room can be for either an individual or a couple (prices to be negotiated). But in general prefer younger people. There are two shared bathrooms in the apartment. The apartment is in Gracia, a very nice area of the city and well positioned on Calle Nil Fabra, right next the the metro station Lesseps. The room is a large double, fully furnished with a brand new bed and mattress.  Im looking for relaxed, respectful and clean people. In total four people will be living in the flat. The flat is really clean and newly painted (a cleaning lady comes to clean the communal areas), HUGE in the living room, high speed wifi throughout the place, central heating, large kitchen, two bathrooms and the building has a lift. none Whilst being very very central Gracia is slightly off the beaten track and therefore large hourds of tourist groups and tourist traps can be avoided somewhat. Gracia is a more authentic experience of cataln culture as opposed to staying on the main strip. Artisan shops, terrace drinking culture, gaudi buildings, beautiful parks, and a buzzing nightlife can all be found here. Regarding the price, it will vary depending on time of year, number of guests, length of stay and other factors. I'm not gonna receive a guest, change bed, clean room etc for one night at the price of 19!Also worthy of note, there is a big friendly dog here. To arrive to the apartment the metro stop is on the green line, PLACA LESSEPS. Metro stop lesseps is a two minute walk away.  From the airport the aerobus is a good option. It will drop you in placa Catalunya and from there it easy to join the metro system. Please indicate your estimated check in time a few days before arrival,if not I may not be at the house to let you in. You are all welcome to come and use the house as if it was your own. The living room is huge and very comfortable! Fully equipped kitchen and dining room, coffee machine with complimentary capsules , two bathrooms, washing machine, WiFi, everything one needs! Young people preferred. Remember that this is my house not a hotel. Sometimes I will not be able to meet you personally to let you into the house. Occasionally I will have to leave the keys in one of my sisters nearby bars and you will have to let yourselves in. Sometimes delays travelling are unforseable, but please try to accurate with your estimates and communicate with me, also respect the fact that I have to wait around for you. More than an hr late and you could find yourself waiting for me in the street.  If you use a space leave it as it was. Dishes, clothes, ANYTHING!  Noise, when you are awake others may be resting, respect there rest and they will respect yours!",3

"My 59 sqm apartment lies on the popular island, Amager, in Copenhagen. It is 3.5 km from inner city with buses going around the clock. It is also near the beach, only 2.5 km with lots of nature.

It is close to the big street Amagerbrogade, were both bus, metro and lots of shops are located. Everything you need is right around the corner and the atmosphere is great. My apartment is characterized by how much I love to travel and learn about cultures and nature. I make most interior myself and love to create new and different things. It is of course also very clear that I am a hunter, and have two big trophies on my walls - I respect that it is not for everyone though. none There are lots of small special stores and neat designer shops in the area, especially on the bigger street, Amagerbrogade. @ The busline 5A has a stop just about 200 meters from the apartment on the street Amagerbrogade.

Guests get access to everything in the apartment, you can go through all drawers etc. in order to use what you need. I will always do my best to communicate with you both before and during your stay - as the rest of the world, I am almost constantly online wherever I go. :) @",1

The neighborhood is lined with sidewalks and filled with Bungalow, Craftsman, and Cottage-style homes.  Cleveland Park is home to critically acclaimed restaurants and bars such as Holland House, The Pharmacy Burger, and Mas Tacos.  The area has been labeled transitional and up-and-coming as it (and most of inner city Nashville) continues to go through the gentrification process.  Cleveland Park is an urban neighborhood that is made up of a very culturally diverse group of people with a great mixture of ethnicities.  We look forward to hosting those who come with the same passion and exuberance for staying in such settings! We have wonderful neighbors all around us, and we ask that you be respectful of your noise levels late at night when on the front porch or on the back deck so as not to disturb them.

No house parties. TAXES: Because we are committed to being part of our community and bettering it in any way we can, we are registered to collect sales/use tax and hospitality tax of I5.25 percent, as is required by the state.  This tax is calculated on the base rental amount (not including Airbnb service fees). Unfortunately Airbnb is not set up to collect these taxes, so like many other hosts in cities that require the collection of taxes, we collect directly from the guest. We try to make this transaction as easy as possible by emailing you an invoice that you can pay online.",3

In case you want to explore Brookland while on your visit to DC, below are some of favorite things to see and do. Brookland sightseeing:  The historic Brookland neighborhood features some of DC's best kept secrets. The safe tree lined streets and beautiful houses make this neighborhood very walkable. Our four local spots are:  1) The Franciscan monastery: peaceful oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The monastery is open to the public and includes a beautiful archway lined garden around the main sanctuary, another huge garden to the side you walk down into and perfect for a picnic. The sanctuary itself is also beautiful. 2) The Basilica: the largest catholic church in North America is right here in Brooklan Please note, we have two young boys you may hear from time to time. We provide a DOHM sound machine for those who wish to reduce any unwanted noise! Tall guests (6 feet tall and up) should take note that the apartment has one area of low ceiling height.

We have parking in our driveway if your car doesn't leak oil (if it does you'll need to park around the corner as there is no street parking on our street overnight).  Using our bikes is a great way to get around and the Ballona Creek Bike Trail will take you to the beaches without exposing you to much car traffic, but bear in mind they do need to be shared with the other guests and the bikes need to be back before it gets dark.

To cover our costs we ask per person 20 for dinner only and 25 for dinner and cocktails/wine. We are very fortunate to live in a beautiful area with great weather and youll be sharing our home; we never host when we ourselves are travelling.

No, unfortunately I can only have a certain number of people in the apartment, and I am currently only accepting single reservations per room.  Where Can I Park? I do not have parking at my apartment, so you will have to do street parking, or pay to park at Kezar Stadium, which is a few blocks away.  In my neighborhood you have to have a permit to park for more than 2 hours from 8am-6pm M-F. (Some areas are 7am-7pm, so watch the signs!)  After 2 hours, you have to move the car about a block.

Parking Notes I generally recommend to visitors not to have a car unless you will be making day trips outside the city.  There are many good transportation options to get around  within the city.  However, if you really need a car you will need a parking permit.   You can get a Muni Passport that will give you unlimited rides on busses, street cars, and cable cars.  Also, if you have an iPhone or Android phone there are applications that will summon a car to take you wherever you need to go.  This is similar to taxi service but is much better.

For getting around I recommend hopping on a bike (we have 2 that you can loan) or getting around by foot - these are by far the best, most flexible ways to experience the city. Headed from the airport to my place, I recommend the metro going directly to Nrreport st. where theres only 5 minutes to the apartment (or a taxi, if you prefer - but its quite expensive compared to the metro). @ We will not be present in the apartment when you're renting it. But we will be in personal contact with you before, during and after your stay. We will happily offer tips on how to make your stay at Copenhagen the best as possible. My home is your home - as long as you treat it like yours. But please do not smoke in my apartment and respect the neighbours, especially at late hours.

We only started hosting on AirBnb since December 2016 which is why we currently have limited reviews; We are hoping that this will change soon! :) This apartment is a separate lower unit (basement) within a home with a private entrance. It is a full 1 bedroom + den/office apartment with your own bathroom and kitchen. There is a super comfy brand new Queen bed in the bedroom (just purchased in November 2016), and a brand new sectional sofa in the living room (also purchased in November 2016). Although the sofa is more of a condo-sized sectional, if someone were wanting to they could certainly sleep on it, though I might not recommend that for someone tall. If you are travelling with a young child, we are happy to provide you with a Pack N' Play. The unit has retrofit status and has been approved by the fire department (High fives for safety! Ha!) :). The bathroom has a rain showerhead and weve had a water filtration system installed in the home so the water is de-chlorinated for bathing and drinking. The kitchen includes a new Kitchenaid gas range, marble countertops and is also stocked with pretty much anything you could need to none If you dont plan on staying in and watching all of our amazing TV channels (Ha!), youll be just steps away from the trendy Ossington strip and a stones throw to Queen Street West. You will have ample amounts of amazing restaurants, bars, cafes and shops. A two minute walk away you will find the renowned Drake Hotel and The Gladstone Hotel, two very popular spots to visit for food & some drinks (and later at night some dancing and karaoke, if youre into that kind of thing).  Well also provide you with a list of bars and restaurants to hit up should you be interested. Not only is this area amazing and have tons of things to do all within walking distance, our place is also surprisingly quiet (the eye of the storm kind of thing). So, should you decide to have a quiet night in and relax, there wont be any issue with that.  Check-in and Check-out times are both flexible. We will do our best to accommodate your requests. Self check-in is possible with our keyless keypad entry system. This is a great place to stay for anyone, whether youre single, paired up, an executive in town for work, or a family looking to explore a new city, were more than confident youd love your stay here. The hosts arent so bad either. ;) You can pretty much walk to anything in this area and you wont be disappointed.  In less than a 1-minute walk youre at the 24-hour Queen streetcar or Ossington bus to head up to Bloor Street for the subway. This is a very easy and convenient area for getting around! You'll have full access to your entire apartment and shared access to the laundry room (no charge for laundry, it is complimentary). Backyard use is limited to smoking only as this area is used by permanent residents of the other units of the home.

My husband and I live in the main floor unit and if we're around we'll be more than happy to help out with any questions you may have. We love our city and are happy to share any of our knowledge with you during your stay! :) Respect your neighbours; please no parties or really loud music Maximum 3 adults per stay (Please keep in mind there is only the 1 Queen sized bed and one condo-sized sectional couch). Our house is child-friendly, please feel free to contact us with any questions you may have. If you wish to have any additional guests visit you during your stay (not overnight), additional guests are limited to 4 and please make sure to let us know if you plan to have guests visit.

The kitchen is stocked with cookware, dishes, and utensils as well as basic ingredients such as cooking oil and certain seasonings (there is a market with a large selection only 3 min walk away.) Also in the apartment are some books and games for the guest to enjoy after a long day of sightseeing.

In general, the rooms, location, and size of the apartment make it a pretty desirable package.  It is close to both the F train (2nd Avenue), the L Train (1st Avenue) and the 6 Train (Astor Place). The two rooms that are available are the largest and second largest rooms.  Room #1 has a private fire escape off of the room, queen-sized bed and is large and spacious.  Room #2 is also spacious, with a queen-sized bed, quiet and is warm in the winter and cool in none The East Village is perhaps the neighborhood that has retained the most character and authenticity in all of Manhattan. It's very diverse, lively and accessible. Without question, it has the highest percentage of amazing independently-run and reasonably-priced restaurants, bars, clubs and cafes. It also has a ton of independent boutiques, vintage shops, record shops, book stores, and art galleries. It's one of the few places in America where you might be able to walk for a few blocks without running into a single multinational McDonald's, Subway, KFC, etc. Just to be clear, we are renting rooms out in our home, during times in which one or more of us are traveling. If you're looking for a slightly less personal and unique hospitality experience, perhaps a hotel room would be a better fit! What staying with us will give you is the experience of what it feels like to live in one of the best apartments in one of the most interesting neighborhoods in the world. But if it's amenities and a concierge service that you require, this may not be for you. The 2nd Avenue F Train is 4 minutes away, the Astor Place 6 train is 8 minutes away and the 1st Avenue L Train is 8 minutes away. There are express buses running up and downtown on 1st and 2nd Avenues. And there are numerous Citibike locations nearby. In short, it's a great place to land when you come to visit NYC. Guests have access to private fire escape for Room #1, back deck, rooftop, kitchen, living room, bathroom, etc. Regardless of whether I'm traveling or not, I'm generally very accessible via text, email or other apps. We are all helpful and pleasant but quite busy in our own lives. We just ask that guests are respectful of our time and space and we will do the same! Cleanliness, respect of other's privacy, keeping noise levels down at night/in the morning and communication are important.",2

In addition to Lyft and Uber, we are 20 minute walk from the NOMA metro station, and direct  10 minute bus ride to Union Station, the transportation hub of DC. Youll love my place because our house is clean and comfy with a casual living room that includes cable TV and gaming options. Our private room is welcoming and comfortable. Our private room offers a trundle style day bed that can comfortably sleep 2. It is decorated it with international and Washington D.C. inspired artwork. This cozy room also features a desk, drawers, and a full length mirror. Blackout curtains and bright lights ensure that this room is ready to fit your every mood. Power outlets throughout the room ensure that you'll be able to charge all of your power devices where you need them. Extra blankets, pillows, and toiletries are always on hand. none DC is a busy bustling city, but we live on a quiet side street that is just minutes from several action packed spots. We love this spot because it has an old-school DC neighborhood with friendly faces. It's quiet and peaceful compared to a more downtown spot, but there's a great bar scene on H St right around the corner for when we want to go out and live it up. While our street in DC is described as a quiet street, for those who are not accustomed to the sounds of the city, we have provided a noise-neutralizing  machine as well as single-use ear plugs to ensure you get a restful night sleep! As can be seen in our reviews, we have two cats. They're very friendly and well-behaved. We have no problems with locking them out of the private room space, however, we do allow them to free-roam the house. We ask that guests be mindful of the cats when entering or leaving the house and not leaving the door wide open tempting our cats to hang out with nature. Our cats are treated monthly with flea prevention (the outdoor cats in our neighborhood are not-so please be advised) and up to date on all of their shots. We also have two air purifiers around the house and dust/vacuum multiple times a week to ensure which keeps allergens to a minimal-however, if you have a severe cat allergy, our house is probably not a good fit. All honesty-our cats are like dogs and they let us know when its breakfast time in the morning (6:30 AM), please be advised that some people might find their meowing a bit disruptive. We provide a noise-neutralizing machine and single-use ear plugs to help any light sl DC is known as a pedestrian city, we walk a lot. If you're not keen on walking, at the corner by our house is a bus stop that takes you directly to Union Station where you can travel around by bus or metro. We are also near several DC Bikeshare stations, where you can rent a bike to get around (we have a spare helmet for guests), and we live in an area with Uber and Lyft are always within minutes of our house. I often prefer to walk to the NOMA metro, stop in a Starbucks for a cup of coffee or run to CVS or the grocery store for any little knick-knacks I need before taking in the sights of the city. Our house is yours to enjoy. While the private bedroom is a personal space that we will not intrude upon, there are 1.5 shared bathrooms, as well as a living room with a comfortable couch, a desk on the mainfloor, a kitchen, and a dining room with our washer/dryer available to long-term guests. Katie is a passionate cook and so our kitchen is fully stocked with cooking basics and spices which our guests are welcome to respectfully utilize. We also have both front (covered) and back (uncovered) porches available for guests to enjoy fresh air, sunshine. If you are a smoker, there are ashtrays in both places for you as well. We recommend using public transportation in DC as there are so many options and traffic can be brutal, but if you are driving in there is street parking available. Depending on the time of day, finding a spot right in front of our house can be tricky, but we are able to advise on closeby and safe parking spaces if guests are unable to find one on our street. Shelby and I are extremely social people and love to socialize with our guests, but we are also very busy people so sometimes we are out and about all day. We are both very responsive to texts through the Airbnb app and are often only a few minutes from the house should a guest need us. While we love to socialize, we understand that many guests need their quiet time on work-related travel and we are very respectful of that as well. - There are two cats in the house-they can be kept out of the private room - Bathroom must be used respectfully - Kitchen must be used respectfully",3

Insider tip: If you dont want to carry your luggage upstairs all by yourself, take a cab to the apartment and pay the taxi driver to help you! And then: Enjoy Copenhagen!

Why stay in the outskirts of the CBD when you can reside in an awesome space directly in the center of all the action? Why stay in a sterile, overpriced motel when you can have an entire apartment to yourself? Whether you want to explore Melbourne's CBD right out the front door, or relax in modern, homely style, this place won't leave you wanting anything more. none This is Melbourne's premiere neighborhood with eateries and coffee shops at your door step! You will be within walking distance of: - Classic alfresco laneways - An array of amazing bars  - All of Melbourne's CBD tourist attractions. - Shopping Outlets such as Zara, H&M, Top Shop and Uniqlo @ It's about 100m walk to Flinders Street Train Station. There you can buy a MYKI card (a commuter card required to access all public transport), but keep in mind, all trams are FREE in the CBD, hence you don't need a MYKI when traveling within the CBD. If leaving the CBD you will need 1 MYKI card each, and you can 'top up' your card right beside the train station entrance, or at any 7-11 store. There are also trams that run on Flinders Street, Swanston Street and Elizabeth Street, that can take you to just about anywhere in Melbourne, or connect you up to other areas around our beautiful city. There are also buses that run along Flinders Street. Simply visit the local journey planner / timetable website to find a service and time/day that suits you to travel.

I'm happy to be flexible about access and picking up keys, but if you can confirm a rough arrival time before booking your stay that would allow me to plan around my work schedule. Leave the car at home and get public transport, there is a tram stop 20 metres from the front door that goes past the NGV, Federation Square and straight to the city, or 2 minutes walk from the train station that goes into Flinders Street. Being so central there are always plenty of taxis around. If you want to drive, there is free off street parking in roads nearby, but it does get busy so close to Chapel Street at the weekends and evenings. You will have private bathroom and double room to yourself, as well as shared use of the kitchen lounge, washing laundry facilities and balcony space.

"This cute little apartment is 5 mins walk from Harrods. Great value for money as you will be staying in the heart of London close to all the attractions. This flat takes in 4 people. You will be at the door step of Hyde Park and lots of shops. Welcome to my cosy little pad in the heart of Central London. The best thing about this apartment is the fabulous location - the flat is 7 minutes walk to the Knightsbridge tube station and 5 minutes walk from the world's most famous store, Harrods!  When in London do as the Londoners do! Which is to spend little time inside the apartment and more time outside drinking beer and ale at a local pub. In this area you will not fall short of finding nice bars and restaurants (See neighbourhood section).  But first, more about the apartment itself. The flat located in the basement level so you need to walk down 8-10 steps. The stairs are quite narrow so bring your slimline suitcases along.  The main door opens into a living room. It is simply furnished with a sofabed and a dining table should you wish to eat in. There is cable TV and wifi available for use. The living room leads into a kitchen which is equipped with everything you need. I provide tea, coffee, sugar and basic condiments to ge none Harrods is just one of the many amazing things about Knightsbridge. Recently the world's most expensive apartments were unveiled at One Hyde Park - this is 7 mins walk from the flat! The grand and beautiful Hyde Park is also less than 10 mins walk away from the apartment.  Before embarking on a trip over here, make sure to save up so you can try some of the most fantastic restaurants in London.  If you are looking for some high end eateries try Zuma, Bar Boulud or the lovely Indian at Amaya.  For those looking for more budget options there are plenty of cafes and restaurants on the high street. Alternatively you can buy some fresh produce from the food halls of Harrods and cook yourself a spectacular means. The food halls at Harrods are just the most amazing place to find curious delicacies from around the world.  There is lots of shopping to be had in Knightsbridge. Fancy a shoe? Head to the flagship stores of Jimmy Choos or Manolo Blanik. If you want more quantity and less quality, t I believe that it is best to be accurate about the listing to avoid disappointing my guests. So here are the things to keep in mind:  - the flat is located in the basement level  - there are about 8-10 steps - due to the location the flat is not what I would call bright and light. You will need to have the lights on in the bedroom.  - this flat is what I would call great value for money for 4 people. If you want a luxury apartment then this is not for you sadly.  - check in after 11 pm may be charged at 40. The closest tube station is Knightsbridge. This is on the Piccadilly line. If you are landing at Heathrow this is very convenient as you can just hop on the Piccadilly line and you will be home in 30-40 mins. The entire apartment is available for guest use. My office and home are located in the same building as this flat so I will be on hand for check ins etc. But my friends at Hostmaker are looking after my home when I am too busy or away. They're an Airbnb management service team of Londoners who are Airbnb hosts themselves. I trust them to give you a warm welcome! Hostmaker will look after you. If you have any questions about your stay, please get in touch through the Airbnb platform. - No parties or loud noises  - No pets - No smoking please",3

There are also plenty of buses going to and from the main road which are just a few minutes walk from the flat. @ @ Guests have access to the entire apartment We send regular emails but only interact directly when there is an issue. Thank you for staying in my flat. I hope you have a wonderful time when in London. Myself and my team are here to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.  If you would kindly follow these simple rules, it would make your stay better and will really help me at the end of the stay to make sure the apartment is ready for the next guests, who will usually be checking in on the same day that you leave. This puts us under a little bit of pressure to make sure everything is ready on time. SHOES:  Kindly remove outside shoes when inside the flat as the flat is on the ground floor and dirt can enter from outside. BE HONEST ABOUT THE NUMBER OF GUESTS STAYING:  We have found that guests sometimes haven't been completely honest about the number of guests staying. More guests staying creates more cleaning work which impacts the incoming guests (more wet towels and bed linen, cleaning takes longer) and is also unfair on my cleaner, Svitlana, who works very hard to get the apartment",2
"My girlfriend and I have a 1BR/1BA apartment (2nd floor) in the Mission Hill area. Conveniently located near two Metro lines (Orange and Green), walking distance from Fenway, the MFA, Sam Adams Brewery, etc. 20 mins. by metro to downtown, 30 mins. to Cambridge! Our apt. is in an older building, but it's been well maintained. We have nice big windows, tall ceilings, lots of light and fresh air. We also have a washer/dryer in the basement, which is a rarity around here! Guests stay on a big air bed and/or couch in the living room. none Lots of great restaurants and bars to choose from, in addition to plenty of sights to see nearby! A diverse neighborhood, good number of students, but laid-back and quiet most of the time. The easiest way to get to our place from the airport is to take the shuttle to the Blue Line and then switch at State Street to the Orange Line and get off at Roxbury Crossing. Take a left when you leave the station and head up two blocks to the light at Parker St. Take a left and walk two blocks till you see our blue building with a big red door. Come around to the side and ring the bell for #2 and I'll let you in! That takes around 40 mins. and costs no more than 5. Or you can take an Uber which costs 20-25 normally and takes about 30 mins.  If we lend you our keys: Oval key opens the outside door on the side of the building (two locks, top and bottom). Square key opens the apartment door (same). Parking available on the street out front. Two metro lines nearby will have you downtown in minutes! Free reign in the kitchen (in terms of storage and cooking utensils), bathroom, and living room. Also feel free to use our in-house laundry machines! Happy to show you around the neighborhood on nights/weekends or help you navigate public transport in order to get where you're going! Also, we are pleased to welcome guests of all races, ethnicities, religions, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, ability level, etc. Interacting with people of different perspectives and backgrounds than our own is one of the best parts of being an AirBnB host.

The apartment is on the ground floor, so no hassle with luggage up and down staircases! N.B.: Because the apartment is on the ground floor, the windows have filters on them in order to keep passer-byers from 'peeking' in. This is a common practice in Amsterdam houses.

"My place is close to Moulin de la Galette, the popular restaurant Marcel, and of course the Sacr-Coeur Basilica (you can see it from the balcony).  You'll love my place because of the location -- the heart of Montmartre village, the views, and all the natural light. A very charming, spacious apartment with lots of natural light and opens views. Separate modern (newly renovated!) kitchen with: oven, microwave, large fridge and with easy to use stove with modern induction plates and ventilation above, a small breakfast table and a large window. One bathroom (bathtub+shower) with a toilet, and another separate toilet.  One bedroom with desk and printer, and a separate one in a enclosed and comfortable mezzanine-like room. (When we share the apartment, you get the double-bed and I'll be downstairs. We both share the large living room with couch and table). I have a couple of personal belongings (in boxes that are in the entrance hallway, and in my room's closet) but this doesn't take up much space or prevent you from benefitting from the apartment :) If you need shelf or hanging space I can make some for you -- please let me know! none The Montmartre area is wonderful; people call it a village and really has that feeling. This street is quiet and not overrun with tourists as it is closer to the Sacr-Coeur. There are plenty of parks, theatres, great restaurants and bars around, and it is easy to quickly get to other parts of the city. - Feel free to use the record player! You can also connect your computer/phone to the speakers. The stop Lamarck-Caulaincourt is the closest metro stop (2 min away) on the 12 line. You can also access the 12 line at Abbesses.  The 2 line is 4 minutes away at Blanche.  The bus 80 is 3 minutes away and takes you to the 8th/Champs Elyse more directly -- though it does take longer-- than subway options :) The whole apartment, except my room :) I work during the day but I'll usually be available for any questions. I'd be happy to show you around or give you tips on where to go in the neighborhood. - You can smoke on the balcony.  - There is a whole bunch of porcelain/china in a living room cabinet. Please don't use those, everything you need is in the kitchen :)",1

It is a truly ""zen"" feeling. One of us is an artist and the other not at all, so we have managed to balance small artistic touches within a more clean and neutral environment.
