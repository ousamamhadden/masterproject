He uses the side entrance to gain access to his own apartment.  Please do not go up to the 3rd floor as this is private to him.  If you should meet on the stairs, introduce yourselves!  He is very nice and generally quiet. Operation of the flat-screen TV is a bit tricky and we will have to show you the process.  Use of the rowing machine and bow-flex machine in the exercise room is allowed, but only after we go over the operation first. This is an old house.

"It is tucked away on the top floor to the back of the building, with great light pouring through the 4 large windows in the main space. But you have the added feature of having dark drapes that allow for a cozy cocoon for sleep and that much needed escape from the chaos that is NYC.  As the name implies, it is studio of serenity, for it is very quiet. Beautifully quiet 520 sq ft Studio in refurbished red brick building in Spanish Harlem, NYC.  Within close proximity to mast transit. The 520 sq ft studio is on the 5th/top floor of the elevator building, to the back of building, overlooking the back courtyard of the adjacent buildings. All at a respectable distance that allows for privacy. Kitchen and bath are separate from the main studio and each have windows that allow for natural light. The main studio also has natural light from the four windows around the room. The style is very much an eclectic mix of east/west which marries the past with the modern. Of the upmost importance is that the building is next to an above ground Metro North train track and you will experience the muffled sound of the train as it passes. I indicate that the space is quiet in comparison to the other apartments located to the form or side that faced the track. Clean, quiet and serene atmosphere that provides an escape from the hectic pace of NYC. As the",3
