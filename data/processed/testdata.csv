Our townhouse sits near the border with, what I think most interesting LA neighborhood, - VENICE BEACH.

To get to the beach - you can just take a Left on Venice blvd. or we really like to take our street - Beethoven which turns into Rose avenue -- all the way to the beach.  It's a very scenic view and you pass on your way Whole Foods (great tasty and organic grocery store and deli), row of trendy good restaurants (on your Right around 5th ave) and interesting shops.  It takes about 10-15 minutes to bike to Venice Beach; 5 minutes to drive there and about 10-15 minutes to SANTA MONICA.
